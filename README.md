# Synthesia
Synthesia Arduino LED Prototype

I picked up this sound shield, which attaches to the top of the Arduino: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/spectrum-shield-hookup-guide-v2

The shield analyzes an analog frequency and splits it into 7 bands of low - mid - high frequencies. This is great because I can then use these values to color lights on a LED strip.

I used this LED Strip tutorial to hook up lights to the Arduino digital out: https://www.temposlighting.com/guides/how-to-add-custom-leds-to-any-project

The result is magic. I turn low frequencies into warm orange colors and the higher frequencies into blue / purple colors. I also added a slight afterglow to the lights to make it feel more like an incandescent bulb.
